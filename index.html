    <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
    <p>
      We deal in all types of Kenya coffee grades specializing in top quality 
      <strong>AB, AA, and PB</strong>.  
      We also deal with Kenya Coffee and have two types: 
      <b>Type 1</b> and <b>Type 2</b>.
    </p>

    <h4>Top Qualities AB, AA and PB</h4>
    <p>
      We select the best AB, AA and PB from high growing coffee areas like Nyeri, Kirinyaga, 
      Kiambu and Muranga counties among other coffee regions in Kenya.  
      We look for coffee with fruit flavour, citrus flavour, heavy body, wild honey, and sharp acidity.  
      We mainly deal with two types of grinders:
